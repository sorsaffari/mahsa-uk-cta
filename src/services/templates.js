Cutting off the internet has been an effective method which the regime has used several times over the years to control the protests and kill thousands of innocent people in Iran. The 2019 blackout was the most wide-scale internet shutdown ever in Iran. It was the most severe disconnection tracked by NetBlocks in any country in terms of its technical complexity and breadth. This is happening again. As unrest grows, Iran restricts access to Instagram, WhatsApp two of the last remaining social networks in the country, amid protests over the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody. This was confirmed by residents and internet watchdog NetBlocks. Not only the Iranian regime has blocked access to internet and social media, but outrageously Instagram and WhatsApp have now been restricted for all users registered with an Iranian, +98, phone number, across all major network operators. The owner alleged that they have not restricted the Iranian numbers, however, the service is still not available to the +98 numbers. As a result, Iranians living in the UK and around the globe are unable to contact their friends and families in Iran through the Internet.",
